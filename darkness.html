<h1> WAKE UP TO REALITY </h1>
<p> Nietzsche once said "Gaze into the abyss long enough and eventually the abyss gazes back at you"
I think not. There is a way to end this sickly stalemate and emerge victorious. Jump. Dive. Descend
into the darkness and plunge yourself into the abyss, after all even the abyss can't gaze at you
when you're gouging out its wretched eyes. Descend into darkness and emerge victorious as the champion
of the forgotten nexus. Crawl out and live. Rise up and reign your monarchy over the mindless
peons.</p>
